# TGWebDrive

**Self-hosted cloud drive that turns Telegram into unlimited free storage.**

TGWebDrive is a personal (or team) file drive that stores everything inside Telegram chats/channels via the Telegram API — giving you effectively unlimited, free cloud storage with a polished Google Drive-style web UI, background uploads, public share links, multi-user access, full white-label branding, and a REST API.

No AWS bill. No storage limits. No vendor lock-in. Just Telegram.

## Why TGWebDrive?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Infinite free storage** | Files live in your own Telegram Saved Messages or a private channel. Telegram gives every account ~unlimited cloud storage. |
| **Real streaming** | Videos and audio play inline with seeking (HTTP range support) — no full download before playback. |
| **Public sharing** | Beautiful share pages for files & folders, with optional passwords, expiry, and **"Download all" as ZIP**. |
| **White-label branding** | Rename the app, set your accent color, upload your logo, and customize the footer — fully yours. |
| **Multi-user** | Admins manage users (admin / user roles). Each session is isolated. |
| **REST API** | Ship API keys and automate uploads/downloads from scripts or other apps. |
| **Background transfers** | Uploads continue while you navigate the app, with progress, cancellation, retry, and service-worker recovery. |
| **No build step** | Vanilla JS frontend. Clone, `npm install`, run. |

- Upload (streamed, chunked) — up to 2 GB per file, ~4 GB with Telegram Premium
- **Large files auto-split**: anything bigger than ~1.9 GB is transparently split into ≤2 GB Telegram parts that reassemble into a single file on download (no extra steps)
- Download, rename, delete, search
- Auto-generated thumbnails for images (via `sharp`); native Telegram thumbnails for videos/docs
- Grid and list views with bulk selection and actions

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sam8r/TGWebDrive.git
cd TGWebDrive
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then edit SECRET and PUBLIC_URL
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3001`, create your admin account, and connect a Telegram account using an `api_id` + `api_hash` from <https://my.telegram.org>.

> Full deployment guide (PM2, Apache/Nginx reverse proxy, HTTPS) lives in **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

## Configuration

All settings are optional except `SECRET`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3001` | HTTP port the app listens on |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (keep `127.0.0.1` behind a reverse proxy) |
| `SECRET` | *(auto-generated)* | 64+ hex chars used to sign session cookies & share tokens. **Set your own** with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | — | Public base URL (no trailing slash), e.g. `https://drive.example.com`. Used to build share links. |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `2147483648` | Max upload size (2 GB; Telegram's per-file cap) |
| `SPLIT_PART_BYTES` | `~2040109465` | Files larger than this are auto-split into multipart entries that reassemble on download. Defaults to ~1.9 GiB for a safe margin under Telegram's 2 GiB cap. |
| `API_PRESETS` | — | Optional `api_id:api_hash,api_id:api_hash` presets shown on the login screen |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | **Required.** Postgres connection string, e.g. `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/tgdrive` |
| `DATABASE_SSL` | `false` | Set `true` for managed Postgres providers that require SSL |

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express 4, Postgres (`pg`), GramJS (`telegram`)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS SPA — no framework, no bundler
- **Imaging:** `sharp` for thumbnails
- **Archiving:** `archiver` for folder ZIP downloads

---

## How it works

```
Browser  ──▶  TGWebDrive (Express)  ──▶  Telegram API (GramJS)
                   │
                   └─ Postgres (metadata, users, shares, API keys)
```

Files are never stored on your server's disk — the app streams them straight between the browser and Telegram. Your server only keeps lightweight metadata (filenames, sizes, share links, users) in Postgres.

---

## Deployment Notes

TGWebDrive needs a persistent Node.js process. It is not a drop-in deployment for Vercel or Netlify serverless functions because it maintains Telegram sessions, SQLite metadata, streamed uploads/downloads, and long-lived progress connections.

Use a VPS, or a persistent Node.js host such as Railway, Render, or Fly.io. Keep the `data/` directory backed up: it contains the SQLite database, Telegram sessions, and uploaded branding assets. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for PM2, reverse proxy, HTTPS, and upload-size configuration.

## Roadmap

- [ ] 2FA / TOTP login for admins
- [ ] Per-user branding presets
- [ ] Resume support for large downloads
- [ ] Share analytics / view counts
